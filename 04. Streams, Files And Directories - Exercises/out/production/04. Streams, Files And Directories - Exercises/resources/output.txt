2. IN FAIR VERONA, WHERE WE LAY OUR SCENE,
3. FROM ANCIENT GRUDGE BREAK TO NEW,
4. WHERE CIVIL BLOOD MAKES CIVIL HANDS.
5. FROM FORTH THE FATAL LOINS OF THESE TWO
6. A PAIR OF STAR-CROSS'D LOVERS TAKE THEIR LIFE;
7. WHOSE MISADVENTURED PITEOUS OVERTHROWS
8. DO WITH THEIR DEATH BURY THEIR PARENTS' STRIFE.
